  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: High-throughput genotyping microarrays assess
	both total DNA copy number and allelic composition, which makes them
	a tool of choice for copy number studies in cancer, including total
	copy number and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses. Even after
	state of the art preprocessing methods, allelic signal estimates
	from genotyping arrays still suffer from systematic effects that
	make them difficult to use effectively for such downstream analyses.
	RESULTS: We propose a method, TumorBoost, for normalizing allelic
	estimates of one tumor sample based on estimates from a single matched
	normal. The method applies to any paired tumor-normal estimates from
	any microarray-based technology, combined with any preprocessing
	method. We demonstrate that it increases the signal-to-noise ratio
	of allelic signals, making it significantly easier to detect allelic
	imbalances. CONCLUSIONS: TumorBoost increases the power to detect
	somatic copy-number events (including copy-neutral LOH) in the tumor
	from allelic signals of Affymetrix or Illumina origin. We also conclude
	that high-precision allelic estimates can be obtained from a single
	pair of tumor-normal hybridizations, if TumorBoost is combined with
	single-array preprocessing methods such as (allele-specific) CRMA
	v2 for Affymetrix or BeadStudio's (proprietary) XY-normalization
	method for Illumina. A bounded-memory implementation is available
	in the open-source and cross-platform R package aroma.cn, which is
	part of the Aroma Project (http://www.aroma-project.org/).},

  title = {Parent-specific copy number in paired tumor-normal studies using

  journal = {Bioinformatics},
  year = {2011},
  month = {May},
  note = {(in press)},
  abstract = {Motivation:
	
	High-throughput techniques facilitate the simultaneous measurement
	of
	
	DNA copy number at hundreds of thousands of sites on a genome. Older
	
	techniques allow measurement only of total copy number, the sum of
	the
	
	copy number contributions from the two parental chromosomes. Newer
	
	single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) techniques can in addition enable
	
	quantifying parent-specific copy number (PSCN). The raw data from
	
	such experiments are two-dimensional, but are unphased. Consequently,
	
	inference based on them necessitates development of new analytic
	
	methods.
	
	
	Methods:
	
	We have adapted and enhanced the circular binary segmentation (CBS)
	
	algorithm for this purpose with focus on paired test and reference
	
	samples. The essence of paired parent-specific CBS (paired PSCBS)
	is
	
	to utilize the original CBS algorithm to identify regions of equal
	
	total copy number and then to further segment these regions where
	
	there have been changes in PSCN. For the final set of regions, calls
	
	are made of equal parental copy number and loss of heterozygosity
	
	(LOH). PSCN estimates are computed both before and after calling.
	
	
	Results:
	
	The methodology is evaluated by simulation and on glioblastoma data.
	
	In the simulation PSCBS compares favorably to established methods.
	
	On the glioblastoma data PSCBS identifies interesting genomic regions,
	such
	
	as those implying copy-neutral LOH.
	
	
	Availability:
	
	The paired PSCBS method is implemented in \pkg{psCBS},
	
	which is an open-access and open-source \pkg{R} package.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Array CGH technologies enable the simultaneous measurement
	of DNA copy number for thousands of sites on a genome. We developed
	the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm to divide the genome
	into regions of equal copy number. The algorithm tests for change-points
	using a maximal t-statistic with a permutation reference distribution
	to obtain the corresponding P-value. The number of computations required
	for the maximal test statistic is O(N2), where N is the number of
	markers. This makes the full permutation approach computationally
	prohibitive for the newer arrays that contain tens of thousands markers
	and highlights the need for a faster algorithm. RESULTS: We present
	a hybrid approach to obtain the P-value of the test statistic in
	linear time. We also introduce a rule for stopping early when there
	is strong evidence for the presence of a change. We show through
	simulations that the hybrid approach provides a substantial gain
	in speed with only a negligible loss in accuracy and that the stopping
	rule further increases speed. We also present the analyses of array
	CGH data from breast cancer cell lines to show the impact of the
	new approaches on the analysis of real data. AVAILABILITY: An R version
	of the CBS algorithm has been implemented in the "DNAcopy" package
	of the Bioconductor project. The proposed hybrid method for the P-value
	is available in version 1.2.1 or higher and the stopping rule for
	declaring a change early is available in version 1.5.1 or higher.},
