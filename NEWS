
Package: PSCBS
==============

Version: 0.41.1 [2014-03-28]
o Added unTumorBoost() to recalculating the segment means and other
  statistics for a given PairedPSCBS profile based on non-TumorBoosted
  tumor BAFs (rather than TumorBoost:ed tumor BAFs).


Version: 0.41.0 [2014-03-26]
o Now estimateKappaByC1Density() give more informative error messages
  if it failed to identify modes for estimating the parameter.
o Added argument 'from' to estimateKappaByC1Density().
o BUG FIX: updateMeansC1C2() for PairedPSCBS did not handle missing
  values (=splitters) in the 'c1c2Swap' field.
o BUG FIX: updateMeans() for PairedPSCBS and NonPairedPSCBS returned the
  incorrect DH segment levels for region in AB if adjustFor="ab" and
  likewise for segments in LOH if adjustFor="loh".  This bug does *not*
  affect any of PSCBS methods themselves, because none of them utilizes
  those 'adjustFor' options.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 0.40.4 [2014-02-04]
o BUG FIX: all.equal() for CBS would pass the first/dispatch argument
  to NextMethod() as 'target=target' and not as 'object=target', which
  would result in it being passed it twice both named and non-named
  where the latter would become argument 'tolerance=target' in an
  internal call to all.equal() for numerics.  In recent R-devel version
  this would generate "Error in all.equal.numeric(target[[i]],
  current[[i]], check.attributes = check.attributes, : 'tolerance'
  should be numeric  Calls: stopifnot ... all.equal.default ->
  all.equal.list -> all.equal -> all.equal.numeric".


Version: 0.40.3 [2014-01-29]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now segmentByPairedPSCBS() asserts that argument 'muN'
  is not all NAs.  Similarily, if 'muN' is called from 'betaN' the
  same assertion is done after calling.


Version: 0.40.2 [2013-12-17]
o Now estimateDeltaCN() for CBS have the option to estimate the size
  of a copy-number unit based on the change-point magnitutes, in
  addition to the estimator based on the density of segment means.
o BUG FIX: getChangePoints() for CBS returned empty results.


Version: 0.40.1 [2013-12-09]
o DOCUMENTATION: The CBS vignette referred to C1 and C2 in one of
  the code examples.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 0.40.0 [2013-12-07]
o CLEANUP: No longer need for an ad hoc NAMESPACE import.


Version: 0.39.8 [2013-12-04]
o DOCUMENTATION: Now the vignette sections on dropping outliers
  before segmentation explains why outliers are dropped whereas in
  the original CBS publication they were shrunk ("smoothed").
  Also, added help for dropSegmentationOutliers().


Version: 0.39.7 [2013-11-27]
o Added callGLAO() for CBS.
o Added encodeCalls() for 'data.frame' object returned by
  getLocusData(..., addCalls=TRUE).
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 0.39.6 [2013-11-23]
o Added clearCalls() for AbstractCBS.
o Added extractSegmentDataByLocus() for PairedPSCBS.
o BUG FIX: estimateDeltaCN() for CBS assumed aroma.light was attached.


Version: 0.39.5 [2013-11-15]
o Added estimateDeltaCN() for CBS.  Added package system test.


Version: 0.39.4 [2013-11-14]
o BUG FIX: callGainsAndLosses() for CBS would not estimate the median
  median CN level correctly if there were "empty" segments (e.g. gaps).
  This was/is due to a bug in segments.summary() of the DNAcopy package.
  Instead, we are now calculating the segment median levels ourselves.
  Added a system package test for callGainsAndLosses().


Version: 0.39.3 [2013-11-05]
o Added basic implementations of setLocusData() and setSegments()
  for AbstractCBS.


Version: 0.39.2 [2013-10-28]
o Now plotTracksManyChromosomes() for PairedPSCBS also supports
  tracks "c1,c2", "c1" and "c2".


Version: 0.39.1 [2013-10-25]
o Now plotTracksManyChromosomes() uses the locus data field 'rho'
  when plotting DH locus-level data.  It only recalculates it from
  the tumor BAFs if the DH signals are not available - if so a
  warning is generated.
o BUG FIX: The 'rho' signals returned by getLocusData(..., fields="full")
  for PairedPSCBS would have values also for homozygote SNPs.



Version: 0.39.0 [2013-10-23]
o Now all warnings generated by DNAcopy::CNA() are suppressed,
  including the common one on "array has repeated maploc positions".
o Added getBootstrapLocusSets() for PairedPSCBS.  Added a package
  system test for it.
o Added argument 'subset' to applyByRegion() for PairedPSCBS.
o Added clearBootstrapSummaries() for PairedPSCBS.
o SPEEDUP: Added argument 'cache' to bootstrapSegmentsAndChangepoints(),
  which caches the results to file if cache=TRUE.


Version: 0.38.6 [2013-10-20]
o Internal restructuring on how bootstrapping of segment means is done.
o BUG FIX: plotTracks() for PairedPSCBS would use argument 'Clim'
  for 'Blim' as well, regardless of what argument 'Blim' is.  This
  bug was introduced in v0.38.3.


Version: 0.38.5 [2013-10-18]
o BUG FIX: The CBS and Paired PSCBS report templates assumed that
  the 'R.utils' package is attached.


Version: 0.38.4 [2013-10-15]
o CLEANUP: Removed a few unnecessary NAMESPACE imports.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 0.38.3 [2013-10-14]
o Now plotTracks() for CBS and PSCBS gives a more informative error if
  'Clim' or 'Blim' is invalid.  If using "auto" (only for CBS) and the
  limits could not be inferred due to an unknown or unset signal type,
  an informative error message reports on this as well.
o Now the package vignettes are in vignettes/ and not in inst/doc/,
  which will not be supported by R (>= 3.1.0).
o ROBUSTNESS: The overriding of append() to become a generic
  function does now call base::append() in the default, instead
  of copy the latter.  All this will eventually be removed,
  when proper support for c, [, [[ etc. has been added everywhere.
o CLEANUP: Now explicitly importing only what is needed in NAMESPACE.


Version: 0.38.2 [2013-10-13]
o BUG FIX: While attaching the package, it could cause a cyclic
  loading of namespaces.


Version: 0.38.1 [2013-10-08]
o Now getSmoothLocusData() for CBS also returns column 'count' which
  specifies the number of (finite) loci averaged over in each bin.
o DOCUMENTATION: Vignette 'Total copy-number segmentation using CBS'
  would display the same plot as vignette 'Parent-specific copy-number
  segmentation using Paired PSCBS'.
o DOCUMENTATION: Renamed vignette 'Paired PSCBS' to 'Parent-specific
  copy-number segmentation using Paired PSCBS'.
o BUG FIX: tileChromosomes() for CBS did not set "tiledChromosomes"
  attribute due to a typo.  This caused plotTracks() for CBS to
  horizontally misplace the plotted segment levels.
  Added a system tests for this for CBS and PairedPSCBS objects.
  Thanks to Ilari Scheinin at VUMC for reporting on this.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 0.38.0 [2013-09-27]
o SPEEDUP: 'R CMD check' is now significantly faster due to
  copying of pre-generated calculations ("memoization").
  For instance, the the same segmentation tests are roughly
  40% faster with this version compared to v0.37.2.
o Now PSCBS imports 'R.cache' (used to only suggest it).


Version: 0.37.2 [2013-09-27]
o SPEEDUP: Now utilizing 'matrixStats' functions in more places.
o ROBUSTNESS: Further improved how aroma.light is handled for
  backward compatibility.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 0.37.1 [2013-09-26]
o CLEANUP: Now package avoids attaching suggested packages such as
  'R.cache', 'aroma.light', and 'Hmisc' by only importing the set of
  functions needed via '::'.  This way those packages are only loaded.
  Packages that still need to be attached are done so "quietly".
o CLEANUP: Minor adjustments to some of the internal workarounds
  for older versions of 'matrixStats' and 'aroma.light'.
o BUG FIX: Forgot to import several functions from 'matrixStats'.
  These went undetected because 'aroma.light' (<= 1.31.5) attaches
  the 'matrixStats'.
o BUG FIX: segmentByPairedPSCBS() assumed 'aroma.light' was attached.
o BUG FIX: One of the system tests assumed 'R.utils' was attached.


Version: 0.37.0 [2013-09-21]
o CLEANUP: Package no longer attaches 'R.utils', only imports it.
o BUG FIX/WORKAROUND: For now, package attaches the 'utils' package.
  This is needed due to what appears to be a bug in how 'R.oo'
  finalizes Object:s assuming 'utils' is attached, which may not be
  the case (unless 'R.oo' itself is attached).
o ROBUSTNESS: Now package imports only what is needed from 'DNAcopy'.
o BUG FIX: callGNL() for PairedPSCBS used non-defined 'verbose' object.


Version: 0.36.2 [2013-09-18]
o DOCUMENTATION: Added vignette 'Total copy-number segmentation using CBS'.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now package imports 'matrixStats' (previously suggested).
o ROBUSTNESS: Now package declares S3 methods in the NAMESPACE.
o ROBUSTNESS: Package vignettes no longer assumes that the 'R.rsp'
  package is attached.
o ROBUSTNESS: Forgot to import R.methodsS3::appendVarArgs().
o WORKAROUND: For R (< 3.0.0), hclustCNs() for AbstractCBS would generate
  'Error in rowAlls(ok) : could not find function "loadMethod"'. This
  seems to be a bug in R (< 3.0.0), which we can avoid by attaching the
  'methods' package in hclustCNs().
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 0.36.1 [2013-09-10]
o CLEANUP: Package no longer utilizes ':::'.


Version: 0.36.0 [2013-08-15]
o Made extractMinorMajorCNs() for PairedPSCBS acknowledge additional
  fields related to (C1,C2).


Version: 0.35.6 [2013-08-01]
o Updated the vignettes to utilize the new R.rsp features.


Version: 0.35.5 [2013-07-19]
o ROBUSTNESS: Added a sanity check on the estimates of (tauA, tauB)
  when they are estimated from data in segmentByNonPairedPSCBS().


Version: 0.35.4 [2013-07-11]
o Updated the Makefile for the vignettes and added .Rinstignore such
  that auxiliary (bib and bst) LaTeX files are not installed but
  part of the build so they are available to R CMD check, which
  is recently needed by R devel.
o Bumped up package dependencies.


Version: 0.35.3 [2013-05-25]
o Minor speedup by replacing all rm(x) with x <- NULL, cf. R-devel
  thread 'Assigning NULL to large variables is much faster than rm() -
  any reason why I should still use rm()?' on May 25, 2013.


Version: 0.35.2 [2013-05-20]
o CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd \usage{} lines are at most 90 characters long.


Version: 0.35.1 [2013-05-07]
o Now estimateDeltaCN() for PairedPSCBS adjust for the ploidy if set.
o Added ploidy() and ploidy()<- for AbstractCBS.
o Now tileChromosomes() no longer gives warnings on "max(i): no
  non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf".


Version: 0.35.0 [2013-04-23]
o SPEEDUP: Now bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS always
  estimates the default quantiles in addition to any requested ones.
o SPEEDUP: Made bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() much faster by adding
  use.names=FALSE to two internal unlist() statements.
o BUG FIX: updateMeans() for PairedPSCBS and NonPairedPSCBS could
  include a signal from a neighboring segment when averaging, iff
  that signal was located at the exact locus of the change point.
  Thanks Ingrid Lönnstedt (WEHI) for reporting on this.


Version: 0.34.9 [2013-04-22]
o Utilizing new startupMessage() of R.oo.
o BUG FIX: updateMeans() would not always preserve the originally
  specified segment-mean level estimator, if different from a
  (sample) mean estimator, e.g. avgDH="median".  This could result
  in for instance callAB() failing on internal sanity checks.
o BUG FIX: Segment levels drawn by plotTracks() would have incorrect
  genomic locations for chromosome 2 and beyond.  This bug was
  introduced in v0.34.7.


Version: 0.34.8 [2013-04-20]
o CLEANUP: Removed previously deprecated methods for AbstractCBS.


Version: 0.34.7 [2013-04-18]
o Added more arguments to plotTracks().
o Now drawLevels() and drawConfidenceBands() for CBS and PairedPSCBS
  also works for multiple chromosomes.
o One of the system tests for segmentByPairedPSCBS() failed
  in the case when the data was downsampled (in order to meet
  the CRAN requirements).  The workaround is to use a fix deltaAB
  parameter in that case.
o BUG FIX: Internal calcStatsForCopyNeutralABs() would give an
  error if there was exactly two AB segments.


Version: 0.34.6 [2013-04-11]
o BUG FIX: plotTracks(fit, callLoci=TRUE) would color loci incorrectly
  if more than one chromosome are plotted.


Version: 0.34.5 [2013-04-09]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now callROH() gives an informative error if called
  on a NonPairedPSCBS object.


Version: 0.34.4 [2013-04-05]
o Added more end-user control to plotTracks().


Version: 0.34.3 [2013-04-04]
o Now package builds with both R.rsp (< 0.9.1) and R.rsp (>= 0.9.1).


Version: 0.34.2 [2013-03-28]
o Updated callGainNeutralLoss(), which now by default utilizes
  callCopyNeutral().


Version: 0.34.1 [2013-03-21]
o Updated the report generator and its RSP templates.
o DOCUMENTATION: Clarified in the PSCBS vignette that the NTCN
  caller is under development, experimental.
o SPEEDUP: Made dropChangePoints() faster by only updating the
  segment statistics/means at the very end.


Version: 0.34.0 [2013-03-19]
o CALLING: Defined a formal hypothesis test for how segments are called
  copy-neutral in TCN (NTCN), with the null hypothesis being that a
  segment is NTCN.  In order for a segment to not be NTCN, its confidence
  interval has to be completely outside the null region.  This changed
  how callCopyNeutralByTCNofAB() for PairedPSCBS calls segments; it is
  now a bit more conservative in rejecting NTCN.


Version: 0.33.4 [2013-03-19]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now calcStatsForCopyNeutralABs() for PairedPSCBS does
  a better job in identifying the TCN mode of the AB segments.
o Added argument 'flavor' to findNeutralCopyNumberState() specifying
  how to identify the main mode of the AB segments.
o VISUALIZATION: Now plotTracks() for PairedPSCBS displays thresholds
  for calling AB, LOH and and NTCN.


Version: 0.33.3 [2013-03-12]
o DOCUMENTATION: Documented 'tauA' and 'tauB' in the help for
  segmentByNonPairedPSCBS().


Version: 0.33.2 [2013-03-09]
o Added getLocusData() for PairedPSCBS and NonPairedPSCBS.
o Added an Authors@R field to the DESCRIPTION.
o DOCUMENTATION: Updated the vignettes and the report templates to
  utilize the new ggplot2 themes - ggplot2 no longer gives a
  warning on using deprecated functions.
o Now report() for AbstractCBS also includes files listed in the
  optional file '.install_extras' of the source RSP template
  directory.  The same filename is used by 'R CMD build/check' for
  including additional source files needed to build the vignettes.


Version: 0.33.1 [2013-03-07]
o Relaxed the internal precision tests of testROH().  This was done
  in response to the CRAN farm lowering its precision on some hosts.
o DOCUMENTATION: Preparing package vignettes for the upcoming
  R 3.0.0 support for non-Sweave vignettes.


Version: 0.33.0 [2013-03-05]
o Added argument 'typeOfWeights' to estimateKappaByC1Density() for
  PairedPSCBS, and hence indirectly to estimateKappa().  The default
  is typeOfWeights="dhNbrOfLoci", which may give too much overall
  weight to very long segments causing the estimator to fail when
  there are only a few number of "C1 = 0" segments.  An alternative
  is to use typeOfWeights="sqrt(dhNbrOfLoci)".


Version: 0.32.6 [2013-03-04]
o DOCUMENTATION: Updated the help usage section for all static methods.


Version: 0.32.5 [2013-02-09]
o Added a VignetteBuilder field to DESCRIPTION.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS did not
  bootstrap from all available loci when calculating total CNs
  statistics, iff the segment had been called run-of-homozygosity
  (ROH). Internal validation tests caught this. Thanks to Oscar Rueda
  at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute for reporting on this.


Version: 0.32.4 [2013-02-07]
o Improved some verbose outputs of bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion().


Version: 0.32.3 [2013-02-05]
o Now pruneByHClust() drops any existing segment calls and quantile
  mean-level estimates.


Version: 0.32.2 [2013-02-01]
o Added resetSegments() for AbstractCBS, which drops extra segments
  columns (e.g. bootstrap statistics and calls) except those
  obtained from the segment algorithm.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now aroma.light is explicitly required in cases
  where it is needed.
o DOCUMENTATION: Added a paragraph on avgDH="median" to the PSCBS
  vignette's 'Experimental' section.


Version: 0.32.1 [2013-02-01]
o BUG FIX: segmentByPairedPSCBS(..., avgDH="median") only worked for
  single-chromosome data.  Same for avgTCN="median".  Thanks Ritu Roy
  at UCSF for reporting on this.


Version: 0.32.0 [2013-01-16]
o Added arguments 'avgTCN' and 'avgDH' to segmentByPairedPSCBS().
o Now updateMeans() and updateMeansTogether() methods can estimate
  the mean levels either by the sample mean or the median.


Version: 0.31.0 [2013-01-05]
o CLEANUP: Now packages R.methodsS3 and R.oo are only imported.
o CLEANUP: Package no longer explicitly imports digest.


Version: 0.30.0 [2012-11-05]
o GENERALIZATION: Now bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() works for more
  "flavors", e.g the default ('tcn') used by segmentByNonPairedPSCBS().


Version: 0.29.9 [2012-11-05]
o DOCUMENTATION FIX: example(segmentByNonPairedPSCBS) was for
  the paired case.
o CRAN POLICY: Further speed up of examples such that they run faster
  with R CMD check.


Version: 0.29.8 [2012-11-04]
o CLEANUP: Replaced all whichVector() with which(), because the
  latter is now the fastest again.


Version: 0.29.7 [2012-11-03]
o Updated deprecated ggplot2 functions in the RSP reports.


Version: 0.29.6 [2012-11-01]
o Bumped up package dependencies.
o CRAN POLICY: Made the examples run faster for R CMD check.


Version: 0.29.5 [2012-10-16]
o ROBUSTNESS/BUG FIX: No longer passing '...' to NextMethod(), cf.
  R-devel thread 'Do *not* pass '...' to NextMethod() - it'll do it
  for you; missing documentation, a bug or just me?' on Oct 16, 2012.


Version: 0.29.4 [2012-09-23]
o Now plotTracks() [and plotTracksManyChromosomes()] draws segment levels
  such that it is easier to see them even when they are overlapping.


Version: 0.29.3 [2012-09-21]
o SPEEDUP: By default bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS no
  longer do sanity checks within the bootstrap loop.  This significantly
  speed up the method.  To run checks, use argument .debug=TRUE.
  In addition, the callNnn() methods that need to call this method,
  does it by decreasing the amount of verbose output substantially,
  which in turn speeds up the process a fair bit.
o Now getSegments(..., splitters=TRUE) for CBS and PSCBS inserts NA
  rows wherever there is a "gap" between segments.  A "gap" is when
  two segments are not connected (zero distance).
o ROBUSTNESS: Now append() for CBS and PSCBS drops column 'length'
  from 'knownSegments', iff it exists.
o Now nbrOfChangePoints() for AbstractCBS calculates only change points
  of connected neighboring segments.
o BUG FIX: seqOfSegmentsByDP() for AbstractCBS would not handle empty
  segments, which could occur if 'knownSegments' for instance included
  centromere gaps.
o BUG FIX: segmentByCBS(... knownSegments) could return segments for
  chromosome 0 even though it did not exist in the input data.


Version: 0.29.2 [2012-09-18]
o REPORT: Now report() for AbstractCBS looks for the RSP template in
  templates/, and as a backup in templates,PSCBS/.  If the latter does
  not exist, it is automatically created as a soft link to templates/
  of the PSCBS package.  This allows anyone to create their own
  customized copy (in templates/) of the default PSCBS RSP report.
o REPORT: Now report(fit, ..., rspTags) for AbstractCBS looks for the
  RSP template named <className>(,<rspTags>),report.tex.rsp, where
  className is class(fit)[1] and  argument 'rspTags' is an optional
  comma-separated character string/vector.  This makes it possible
  to have different types of report for the same class of objects.
o REPORT: Added argument 'force' to report() for AbstractCBS.  This
  will copy the RSP template files again, although they are already
  in reports/ output directory.


Version: 0.29.1 [2012-09-15]
o Added argument 'dropMissingCT' to segmentByPairedPSCBS().


Version: 0.29.0 [2012-09-14]
o Added trial version of pruneByDP() for AbstractCBS.


Version: 0.28.6 [2012-09-13]
o Now tileChromosomes() also adjusts 'knownSegments'.
o Added argument 'dropGaps' to gapsToSegments().
o Updated all.equal() for AbstractCBS to compare locus-level data,
  segments, and other fields.


Version: 0.28.5 [2012-09-13]
o SPEEDUP: Now segmentByCBS(..., undo=+Inf) returns much faster, which
  is possible because there is no need to identify new change points.


Version: 0.28.4 [2012-09-13]
o CONSISTENCY FIX: Changed the behavior of extreme values of argument
  'undo' to segmentByCBS() such that 'undo=0' (was 'undo=+Inf') now
  means that it will not ask DNAcopy::segment() to undo the segmentation,
  and such that 'undo=+Inf' means that no changepoints will be identified.
  The latter case allows you to effectively skip the segmentation but
  still calculate all the CBS statistics across a set of known segments
  via segmentByCBS(..., undo=+Inf, knownSegments=knownSegments).
  Arguments 'undoTCN' and 'undoDH' to segmentByPairedPSCBS() are
  adjusted analogously.  Corresponding system tests were added.


Version: 0.28.3 [2012-08-30]
o Updated code and Rd cross reference to use the 'matrixStats'
  package for weightedMedian(), which used to be in 'aroma.light'.


Version: 0.28.2 [2012-08-20]
o BUG FIX: segmentByNonPairedPSCBS() forgot to specify namespace
  aroma.light when trying to call findPeaksAndValleys().


Version: 0.28.1 [2012-08-15]
o Minor grammatical corrections of the Paired PSCBS vignette.


Version: 0.28.0 [2012-07-22]
o Added argument 'minLength' to gapsToSegments().  The default is no
  longer to drop zero-length (minLength == -1L) segments, because
  if (and only if) such a segment contains a locus, then segmentByNnn()
  will currently generate an (internal) error.
o GENERALIZATION/BUG FIX: Now segmentByPairedPSCBS() drops loci for
  which CT is missing (regardless of betaT). For instance, in rare cases
  when the reference (e.g. the normal) is missing, then it may be that
  CT is missing while betaT is not.


Version: 0.27.4 [2012-07-22]
o Now verbose output of segmentByPairedPSCBS() specifies region
  ranges with greater precision.


Version: 0.27.3 [2012-07-10]
o DOCUMENTATION: Minor updates to the Paired PSCBS vignettes.
o CLEANUP: One redundancy tests relied on a non-critical function
  that will be removed in R.utils 1.16.0 (now in R.devices 2.1.1).


Version: 0.27.2 [2012-07-08]
o Updated package dependencies.


Version: 0.27.1 [2012-07-02]
o Now we refer to "copy neutral" segments as "neutral TCN" segments
  with acronym 'NTCN'.  The corresponding column in the segmentation
  results are labeled correspondingly.  The Paired PSCBS vignette
  was updated accordingly.


Version: 0.27.0 [2012-06-24]
o (An update that should be ignored)
o DOCUMENTATION: Some grammar corrections of the 'Paired PSCBS' vignette.


Version: 0.26.1 [2012-06-05]
o Now segmentByCBS() for data frame:s does a better job identifying
  the CN signals.


Version: 0.26.0 [2012-06-03]
o DOCUMENTATION: Added details to the Paired PSCBS vignette on how
  to call segments that are copy neutral (typically diploid).
o Now argument 'delta' for callCopyNeutralByTCNofAB() of PairedPSCBS
  is calculated via estimateDeltaCN(), which estimates the width
  of the acceptance regions, used for calling copy neutral states,
  to be a function of the normal contamination.


Version: 0.25.3 [2012-06-03]
o BUG FIX: all.equal(target, current) for CBS objects would give an
  error if either 'target' or 'current' had zero segments.


Version: 0.25.2 [2012-05-30]
o Added writeSegments() for DNAcopy objects.
o BUG FIX: as.CNA() for DNAcopy added incorrect chromosome splitters.
o BUG FIX: as.CNA() for DNAcopy would ignore argument 'sample' and
  always return the first sample.


Version: 0.25.1 [2012-05-30]
o DOCUMENTATION: Added details to the Paired PSCBS vignette on how
  to tune the various callers.
o Now callROH() records parameter 'deltaROH' in the results.
o BUG FIX: callLOH(..., force=TRUE) would append multiple 'lohCall'
  columns, if called multiple times.


Version: 0.25.0 [2012-04-20]
o Added a trial (very much true) version of segmentByNonPairedPSCBS().


Version: 0.24.0 [2012-04-20]
o Now it is possible to skip the DH segmentation in Paired PSCBS, i.e.
  segmentByPairedPSCBS(..., flavor="tcn").


Version: 0.23.2 [2012-04-20]
o BUG FIX: segmentByPairedPSCBS() would throw "error in `$<-.data.frame
  `(`*tmp*`, "rho" ..." if some loci had unknown genomic positions.


Version: 0.23.1 [2012-04-20]
o Added RSP report for CBS objects (adopted from ditto for PairedPSCBS).
o DOCUMENTATION: Updated the 'Paired PSCBS' vignette.


Version: 0.23.0 [2012-03-20]
o DOCUMENTATION: Added a package vignette.


Version: 0.22.2 [2012-02-29]
o BUG FIX: plotTracks(..., add=TRUE) for PairedPSCBS would add TCNs
  when BAFs and DHs were intended.


Version: 0.22.1 [2012-02-28]
o Updated package dependencies to R.rsp (>= 0.7.3) so that
  report() for PairedPSCBS no longer require non-public packages.
o Now it is possible to turn off usage of the alpha channel in
  plots generated by report(), which can be handy on systems where
  the default PNG device does not support the alpha channel.
  Example: setOption("PSCBS::report/useAlphaChannel", FALSE).


Version: 0.22.0 [2012-02-27]
o Added report() for PairedPSCBS.


Version: 0.21.0 [2012-02-27]
o Added argument 'fields' to getLocusData() for PairedPSCBS.
o Added renameChromosomes() to AbstractCBS.


Version: 0.20.0 [2012-02-26]
o Added alpha version of callGainNeutralLoss() for PairedPSCBS,
  which certainly will be updated in the future.  This caller
  is tested by the system tests.
o Added dropChangePoints() for AbstractCBS.
o Added some internal utility functions for PairedPSCBS taken
  from the aroma.cn package.  Some of these may become public
  later, but for they should be considered internal.
o ROBUSTNESS: Added more sanity checks validating the correctness
  of what is returned by extractSegments() for CBS and PairedPSCBS.
o BUG FIX: extractSegments() for PairedPSCBS would return incorrect
  row indices, more precisely, overlapping data chunks.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS would resample
  from a subset of the intended TCNs, iff the DH mean was non-finite
  while there were still heterozygous SNPs.  This introduced a bias in
  the estimates, which was neglectable for large segments, but for very
  small segments (a few loci) it could be relatively large.


Version: 0.19.8 [2012-02-23]
o ROBUSTNESS: Package now explicitly depends on 'utils'.


Version: 0.19.7 [2012-02-22]
o BUG FIX: findLargeGaps() did not handle missing values for
  argument 'chromosome'.
o BUG FIX: segmentByCBS(..., knownSegments=knownSegments) would
  incorrectly throw a sanity-check exception if 'knownSegments'
  contains a segment with 'start' and 'stop' positions being equal.
o BUG FIX: Argument 'calls' of plotTracks() for PairedPSCBS was ignored
  if more than one chromosome was plotted.


Version: 0.19.6 [2012-01-24]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now getCallStatistics() for CBS asserts that calls have
  been made.  If not, an exception is thrown.


Version: 0.19.5 [2012-01-21]
o DOCUMENTATION: Added details to the help of callLOH() and callAB() on
  the difference between (AB,LOH)=(TRUE,FALSE) and (AB,LOH)=(TRUE,NA).
o Corrected some of verbose messages of estimateDeltaLOHByMinC1ForNonAB()
  for PairedPSCBS objects.


Version: 0.19.4 [2012-01-10]
o Now example(segmentByPairedPSCBS) and the system tests that are run
  by R CMD check are tuned to (by default) run much faster by segmenting
  using fewer data points and bootstrapping using fewer samples.  This
  update was done to meet the new CRAN policy.  By setting environment
  variable _R_CHECK_FULL_ to '1' the full data set is used instead.


Version: 0.19.3 [2012-01-09]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now extractSegments() for PairedPSCBS gives an informative
  error message that it is not supported if CNs were segmented using
  flavor "tcn,dh".
o BUG FIX: postsegmentTCN() for PairedPSCBS could generate an invalid
  'tcnSegRows' matrix, where the indices for two consecutive segments
  would overlap, which is invalid.  Thanks to Minya Pu for reporting
  on failed sanity check related to this.


Version: 0.19.2 [2011-12-29]
o ROBUSTNESS: Explicitly added 'digest' to the list of suggested packages.


Version: 0.19.1 [2011-12-13]
o Added support for callGainsAndLosses(..., method="ucsf-dmad")
  of CBS objects.


Version: 0.19.0 [2011-12-12]
o Added optional argument 'indices' to getLocusData() to be able
  to retrieve the locus-level data as indexed by input data.
o BUG FIX: Now gapsToSegments() gave invalid segments for chromosomes
  with more than one gap.  Now gapsToSegments() validates argument
  'gaps' and asserts that it returns non-overlapping segments.
o DOCUMENTATION: Clarified in help("segmentByCBS") how missing
  values are dealt with.


Version: 0.18.2 [2011-12-07]
o Now plotTracks() for CBS always returns an invisible object.
o BUG FIX: pruneBySdUndo() for CBS did not work with more than
  one array.


Version: 0.18.1 [2011-12-03]
o Added drawChangePoints() for AbstractCBS.
o Now pruneByHClust() for AbstractCBS updates the segment means.
o Added writeSegments() for PSCBS object.
o Now print() for AbstractCBS returns getSegments(..., simplify=TRUE).
o Added argument 'simplify' to getSegments().
o Added arguments 'name', 'tags' and 'exts' to writeSegments() and
  writeLocusData() and dropped 'filename'.


Version: 0.18.0 [2011-11-28]
o Added pruneByHClust() for AbstractCBS, with implementation
  for CBS and PairedPSCBS.
o extractCNs() for CBS would not return a matrix but a data.frame.
o BUG FIX: extractTotalCNs() for CBS would give an error.


Version: 0.17.4 [2011-11-26]
o Added argument 'updateMeans=TRUE' to callROH() for PairedPSCBS.
o Now bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS preserves NAs
  for DH and (C1,C2) quantiles, if the DH mean level is NA, which
  can happen when a segment is called ROH.  This also makes sure
  that a segment called ROH will not be called AB.
o An internal sanity check of bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() for
  PairedPSCBS would give an error if DH mean levels had been set
  to NA for segments called ROH.


Version: 0.17.3 [2011-11-24]
o Added callSegmentationOutliers() and dropSegmentationOutliers()
  for data frames.
o CLEANUP: Renamed field 'position' of the example data to 'x'.
  This helps us clean up some of the examples.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS would give
  an error, if a segment did not have any TCN signals, which can
  occur when known segments are specified for Paired PSCBS.


Version: 0.17.2 [2011-11-22]
o Added findLargeGaps() and gapsToSegments().


Version: 0.17.1 [2011-11-21]
o BUG FIX: The internal sanity check of testROH() on weights was
  slightly too conservative (required to high precision) when it
  came to asserting that the sum of the weights equals one.
o BUG FIX: resegment() for PairedPSCBS called segmentByCBS()
  instead of segmentByPairedPSCBS().


Version: 0.17.0 [2011-11-19]
o GENERALIZATION: Now it is possible to run Paired PSCBS (without
  TumorBoost) when only genotypes but not BAFs are available for the
  matched normal.


Version: 0.16.3 [2011-11-17]
o Added resegment() for CBS and PairedPSCBS for easy resegmentation.
o Adjusted segmentByCBS() such that it can handle 'knownSegments'
  with chromosome boundaries given as -Inf and +Inf.
o Now argument 'mar' for plotTracks() defaults to NULL.
o ROBUSTNESS: Added redundancy tests for segmentByCBS() and
  segmentByPairedPSCBS() with argument 'knownSegments'.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now segmentByCBS() does more validation of 'knownSegments'.
o FIX: extractRegions() for AbstractCBS would also show verbose output.
o BUG FIX: Now argument/parameter 'seed' is correctly preserved by
  segmentByCBS().  So is 'tbn' for segmentByPairedPSCBS().
o BUG FIX: segmentByPairedPSCBS() would give an error when trying to
  segment DH if the TCN segment contains no data points, which could
  happen if 'knownSegments' specifies an empty segment, e.g. centromere.
o BUG FIX: extractSegments() for CBS would throw an error when
  there were multiple chromosomes.


Version: 0.16.2 [2011-11-16]
o Now segmentByCBS(..., w) stores weights 'w', if given, in the
  locus-level data table of the returned CBS object.
o Added pruneBySdUndo() for CBS, which does what undo.splits="sdundo"'
  for DNA::segment(), but on the already segmented results.
o Now updateMeans() uses locus-specific weights, iff available.
o Added updateBoundaries() for CBS to update (start,stop) per segment.
o CORRECTNESS: Now updateMeans() for CBS identifies loci via internal
  'segRows' field and no longer by locations of segment boundaries,
  which gave slightly incorrect estimates for "tied" loci.


Version: 0.16.1 [2011-11-15]
o Now more segmentation parameters are stored in the CBS object.
o SPEEDUP: Now segmentByCBS() will use memoization to retrieve
  so called "sequential boundaries for early stopping", iff any of
  the DNAcopy::segment() arguments 'alpha', 'nperm' and 'eta' are
  specified.  See also DNAcopy::getbdry().
o Added method="DNAcopy" to estimateStandardDeviation() for CBS, which
  estimates the std. dev. using DNAcopy:::trimmed.variance().
o BUG FIX: extractSegments() for CBS would throw an error, because in
  most cases it would created a corrupt internal 'segRows' field.


Version: 0.16.0 [2011-11-12]
o Added argument 'oma' and 'mar' to plotTracksManyChromosomes() for
  PairedPSCBS for setting graphical parameters when 'add' == FALSE.
o Added callROH().
o Added arguments 'from' and 'adjustFor' to updateMeans().


Version: 0.15.5 [2011-11-04]
o BUG FIX: extractSegment() for AbstractCBS would give an error,
  because it called itself instead of extractSegments().


Version: 0.15.4 [2011-10-30]
o Added save() and load() methods to AbstractCBS, which are wrappers
  for saveObject() and loadObject() that assert the correct class
  structure.  Also, the load() method will automatically update the
  class hierarchy for CBS and PairedPSCBS objects that were saved
  before adding class AbstractCBS.


Version: 0.15.3 [2011-10-23]
o BUG FIX: callAmplifications() for CBS generated an error, if
  more than one chromosome were called.
o BUG FIX: The length of a segment must be defined as 'end-start'
  and not 'end-start+1' so that the the total length of all segments
  adds up correctly.
o BUG FIX: highlightArmCalls() for CBS did not handle empty chromosomes.
o BUG FIX: getCallStatisticsByArms() for CBS would thrown a error if
  argument 'genomeData' did not contain exactly the same chromosomes
  as in the CBS object.


Version: 0.15.2 [2011-10-21]
o Added mergeThreeSegments() to AbstractCBS.
o BUG FIX: Recent updates caused segmentByPairedPSCBS(data) not to
  work when 'data' is a data frame.


Version: 0.15.1 [2011-10-21]
o By setting 'start' and 'end' to NAs in 'knownSegments' (chromosome must
  still be specified), it is possible to insert an empty segment that
  disconnects the two flanking segments, e.g. centromere and the two arms.


Version: 0.15.0 [2011-10-20]
o Added support for specifying priorly known segments, such as chromosome
  arms and centromeres, in segmentByCBS() via argument 'knownSegments'.
o CLEANUP: Dropped a stray debug output message in segmentByPairedPSCBS().


Version: 0.14.3 [2011-10-17]
o Added argument 'asMissing' to dropRegions() for AbstractCBS.


Version: 0.14.2 [2011-10-16]
o Implemented extractCNs() for CBS and PairedPSCBS.
o Added extractTotalCNs() for CBS.


Version: 0.14.1 [2011-10-14]
o Added implementation of extractRegions() for AbstractCBS, which
  utilizes extractSegments().
o Added abstract extractSegments() and extractSegment() for AbstractCBS.
o Now extractTCNAndDHs() for PairedPSCBS passes '...' to getSegments().


Version: 0.14.0 [2011-10-10]
o CLEANUP: Harmonization of several method names.
o CLEANUP: Internal restructuring of the source code files.


Version: 0.13.5 [2011-10-10]
o Added dropChangePoint() for AbstractCBS, which is just a
  "name wrapper" for mergeTwoSegments().
o Added dropRegion() and dropRegions() for AbstractPSCBS, where
  the former is a wrapper for the latter dropRegions().
o Added updateMeans() and mergeTwoSegments() for CBS in addition
  already available PairedPSCBS versions.
o Relabeled column 'id' to 'sampleName' returned by getSegments().
o ROBUSTNESS: Now using getSegments() everywhere possible.
o BUG FIX: For so called "splitter" rows, not all columns returned
  by getSegments() of CBS were missing values.
o BUG FIX: The object returned by as.CBS() of DNAcopy did not have the
  correct class hierarchy.


Version: 0.13.4 [2011-10-08]
o Added all.equal() for AbstractCBS, which does not compare attributes.
o Now internal getChromosomeRanges() of CBS returns a data.frame
  instead of a matrix, and first column is now 'chromosome'.
o Added optional argument 'regions' to getCallStatistics() of CBS
  in order to calculate call statistics on subsets of chromosomes,
  e.g. chromosome arms.
o Added drawChromosomes() for CBS.
o Added getCallStatisticsByArms(), callArms() and highlightArmCalls()
  for CBS objects.


Version: 0.13.3 [2011-10-03]
o GENERALIZATION: Now segmentByCBS() and segmentByPairedPSCBS()
  also accepts a data.frame of locus-level data with column names
  matching the locus-level arguments accepted by the corresponding
  method.
o GENERALIZATION: Now all segmentation result classes (CBS and PSCBS)
  inherits from the AbstractCBS class, which provides methods such
  as getSampleName(), getChromosomes() and getSegments().
o DOCUMENTATION: Added lots of more help pages.
o CLEANUP: Dropped empty callSegments() for PairedPSCBS.


Version: 0.13.2 [2011-09-30]
o GENERALIZATION: Now drawLevels() for PairedPSCBS allows for drawing
  segmentation results in 'betaT' space.
o BUG FIX: plotTracks2(..., panels="dh") gave an error due to a
  forgotten assignment.


Version: 0.13.1 [2011-09-06]
o Added formal class CBS, which holds the segmentation results
  returned by segmentByCBS().  Several methods are available for
  CBS objects, e.g. nbrOfLoci(), nbrOfSegments(), nbrOfChromosomes(),
  getChromosomes(), estimateStandardDeviation() etc.
o Now segmentByCBS() always returns a CBS object.  To coerce to a
  DNAcopy object (as defined in the DNAcopy class) use as.DNAcopy().
o Added coerce methods as.DNAcopy() for CBS objects and as.CBS()
  for DNAcopy objects.


Version: 0.13.0 [2011-09-01]
o GENERALIZATION: Now segmentByCBS() can process multiple chromosomes.
o BUG FIX: Internal methods plotTracksManyChromosomes() and
  tileChromosomes() for CBS did not work at all and therefore
  neither plotTracks() for CBS with more than one chromosome.
o Added append() for CBS objects.


Version: 0.12.2 [2011-08-27]
o CLEANUP: Now R CMD check is no longer giving a note that the
  package loads package 'DNAcopy' in .onAttach().


Version: 0.12.1 [2011-08-08]
o BUG FIX: If dropSegmentationOutliers() would drop an outlier next to
  a change point, such that the total copy-number signal becomes NA,
  then the sanity checks that TCN segments always overlaps DH segments
  would fail.  Now the sanity checks are aware of this special case.
  These sanity checks were moved from bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() to
  segmentByPairedPSCBS().  Thanks Christine To at University of Toronto
  for reporting on this.


Version: 0.12.0 [2011-07-23]
o Added a namespace to the package, which will be more or less
  a requirement in the next major release of R.
o BUG FIX: Recently R devel automatically adds a namespace to
  a package, if missing.  This caused some of the PSCBS examples
  to throw an exception related to incorrect dispatching of cat().


Version: 0.11.7 [2011-07-15]
o DOCUMENTATION: Added a section to help("segmentByPairedPSCBS") on
  the importance of doing a whole-genome PSCBS segmentations if
  calling AB and LOH states afterward.
o DOCUMENTATION: Made it more clear in help("segmentByPairedPSCBS")
  that arguments 'betaT', 'betaN' and 'muN' may contain NAs for
  non-polymorphic loci.


Version: 0.11.6 [2011-07-14]
o BUG FIX/ROBUSTNESS: In some cases, the segmentation table would
  contain column names with incorrect capitalization, e.g. "tcnnbrOfLoci"
  instead of "tcnNbrOfLoci".  This would cause several downstream
  methods to give an error.  The reason for this is that the Hmisc
  package, if loaded after R.utils, overrides capitalize() in R.utils
  with another (buggy?) capitalize() function.  To avoid this, we
  now everywhere specify explicitly that we want the one in R.utils.
  Thanks Christine To at University of Toronto for reporting on this.


Version: 0.11.5 [2011-07-10]
o ROBUSTNESS: Fixed partial argument matchings in arrowsC1C2() and
  arrowsDeltaC1C2() for PairedPSCBS.
o BUG FIX: tileChromosomes() for PairedPSCBS was still assuming the
  old naming convention of column names.  This caused plotTracks()
  to throw an exception when plotting multiple chromosomes.


Version: 0.11.4 [2011-07-07]
o GENERALIZATION: Now the internal estimator function that
  estimateDeltaLOH() uses returns -Inf if all segments are called AB,
  instead of throwing an exception.  This will in turn make callLOH()
  call all segments to be non-LOH.
o DOCUMENTATION: Removed obsolete references to the R-forge repository.
o BUG FIX: Consecutive calls to callAB(..., force=TRUE) would append
  additional 'abCall' columns to the segmentation table instead of
  replacing existing calls.


Version: 0.11.3 [2011-07-06]
o ROBUSTNESS: Added a sanity check to estimateDeltaLOHByMinC1AtNonAB() for
  PairedPSCBS object. The test asserts that there exist segments that are
  not in allelic balance, which are needed in order to estimate DeltaLOH.
o DOCUMENTATION: The description of argument 'chromosome' for
  segmentByPairedPSCBS() did not describe how to segment multiple
  chromosomes in one call.


Version: 0.11.2 [2011-07-05]
o BUG FIX: Output fields 'tcnNbrOfSNPs' and 'tcnNbrOfHets' were
  mistakenly labeled as 'tcnNbrOr...'.  Thanks Christine Ho at
  UC Berkeley for reporting on this.


Version: 0.11.1 [2011-06-28]
o DOCUMENTATION: Clarified that argument 'CT' should be tumor copy
  number ratios relative to the normal.
o DOCUMENTATION: Added Rd help for as.data.frame() of PairedPSCBS.


Version: 0.11.0 [2011-06-14]
o Renamed all column names of returned data frames such that
  they follow the camelCase naming conventions in addition
  to be somewhat shorter too.
o GENERALIZATION: Added argument 'columnNamesFlavor' to segmentByCBS().


Version: 0.10.2 [2011-06-07]
o CLEANUP: Cleaned up the example():s.
o Added more biocViews categories to DESCRIPTION


Version: 0.10.1 [2011-05-31]
o GENERALIZATION: The package can now be *installed* without the
  DNAcopy package being installed.  If package is loaded without
  DNAcopy installed, an informative message will explain how to
  install it.
o Added installDNAcopy(), which will install DNAcopy from Bioconductor.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all DNAcopy functions are called as DNAcopy::nnn().


Version: 0.10.0 [2011-05-29]
o Renamed all arguments, variables, and functions referring to 'tau' to
  refer to 'delta' reflecting the notation of the Paired PSCBS paper.
o Renamed options, example code and help pages to reflect new package name.
o Updated references in help pages.
o Now the paired PSCBS is formally referred to as 'Paired PSCBS'.
o Renamed package to PSCBS (from 'psCBS').


Version: 0.9.54 [2011-04-27]
o Added argument 'maxC' to estimateTauLOHByMinC1ForNonAB().


Version: 0.9.53 [2011-04-14]
o Added argument 'max' to estimateTauAB() and estimateTauLOH().


Version: 0.9.52 [2011-04-14]
o BUG FIX: Argument 'minSize' of callAB() and callLOH() had no effect.


Version: 0.9.51 [2011-04-12]
o Added argument 'minSize' to callAB() and callLOH() for PairedPSCBS.
o Now the a conflicting call in callLOH()/callAB() with
  argument xorCalls=TRUE is set to NA to contrast it from
  a FALSE call.


Version: 0.9.50 [2011-04-12]
o Added argument 'xorCalls' to callLOH() and callAB() for
  PairedPSCBS.  When TRUE (the default), a segment that
  is already called AB will never be called LOH, and vice versa.


Version: 0.9.49 [2011-04-11]
o Updated estimateTauABBySmallDH() for PairedPSCBS to use a
  "symmetric" quantile estimator.
o Added argument 'midpoint' to estimateTauLOHByMinC1AtNonAB().
o BUG FIX: The recent callLOH() would not store the LOH calls.


Version: 0.9.48 [2011-04-10]
o Added callLOH() for PairedPSCBS, which in turn calls
  auxiliary methods.
o Added estimateTauLOH() for PairedPSCBS, which in turn calls
  axillary methods.
o Now callAB(..., force=FALSE) skips the caller if
  allelic-balance calls already exist.
o DOCUMENTATION: Update the example for segmentByPairedPSCBS
  to reflect the restructured AB and LOH callers.


Version: 0.9.47 [2011-04-08]
o Added estimateTauABBySmallDH()
o Added internal weightedQuantile().
o DOCUMENTATION: Added help pages for more methods.
o CLEANUP: Started to restructure the source code files.


Version: 0.9.46 [2011-04-08]
o BUG FIX: postsegmentTCN() for PairedPSCBS could generate an invalid
  'tcnSegRows' matrix, where the indices for two consecutive segments
  would overlap, which is invalid.  This was caught with real data,
  but it seems to have required a very rare combination of data in
  order for it to occur.


Version: 0.9.45 [2011-04-05]
o BUG FIX: estimateHighDHQuantileAtAB() for PairedPSCBS would throw
  an error on an undefined 'trim' if verbose output was used.


Version: 0.9.44 [2011-02-18]
o Added estimateHighDHQuantileAtAB() for PairedPSCBS.


Version: 0.9.43 [2011-02-06]
o BUG FIX: plotTracks2() queried non-existing argument 'tracks'.


Version: 0.9.42 [2011-02-03]
o Added estimateKappa() for estimating the normal contamination.


Version: 0.9.41 [2011-02-02]
o Updated default for 'tauAB' of callABandHighAI() and callABandLowC1()
  to be estimated from data using estimateTauAB().
o Added argument 'tauTCN' to estimateTauAB().


Version: 0.9.40 [2011-01-27]
o Added argument 'flavor' to estimateTauAB() for estimating the
  AB threshold using alternative methods.


Version: 0.9.39 [2011-01-19]
o Added trial version of new plotTracks2(), which will later replace
  plotTracks().  Currently it only works for single chromosomes.
o Added support functions, e.g. updateMeans().


Version: 0.9.38 [2011-01-18]
o DOCUMENTATION: Documented more plotTracks() arguments for PairedPSCBS.
o BUG FIX: Now plotTracks(..., add=TRUE) for PairedPSCBS plots to
  the current figure/panel.
o Now plotTracks(..., add=FALSE) for PairedPSCBS only sets up subplots
  if argument 'tracks' specifies more than one panel.
o Added arguments 'changepoints' and 'col' to plotTracks() for PairedPSCBS.


Version: 0.9.37 [2011-01-18]
o BUG FIX: 'tcnSegRows' and 'dhSegRows' where not updated by
  extractByRegions() for PairedPSCBS.


Version: 0.9.36 [2011-01-14]
o Added estimateTauAB() for estimating the tauAB tuning parameter
  when calling segments in allelic balance.  Updated
  example(segmentByPairedPSCBS) to illustrate how to use it.
o Added extractByRegions() for PairedPSCBS.


Version: 0.9.35 [2011-01-12]
o Now postsegmentTCN(..., force=TRUE) for PairedPSCBS also updates
  the TCN estimates even for segments where the DH segmentation did
  not find any additional change points.


Version: 0.9.34 [2010-12-09]
o BUG FIX: When there were multiple chromosomes processed by
  segmentByPairedPSCBS(), then the returned data object would
  contain 'betaT' identical to 'betaTN'.


Version: 0.9.33 [2010-12-07]
o Added callLowC1ByC1() and callABandLowC1().


Version: 0.9.32 [2010-12-03]
o BUG FIX: In rare cases the bootstrap sanity checks can indeed produce
  an invalid 'range', more precisely where (range[,2] >= range[,1]) is
  not true.  This can happen if there is no variation in the bootstrap
  estimates.  Because of this we allow for some tolerance.


Version: 0.9.31 [2010-12-02]
o Added option "psCBS/sanityChecks/tolerance" for specifying the
  tolerance of some internal sanity checks.


Version: 0.9.30 [2010-12-01]
o Rewrote all code dealing with the identification of loci belong
  to segments.  The code is now utilizing the 'segRows' element
  returned by DNAcopy::segment().  Lots of the code was rewritten
  and therefore completely new bugs may have been introduced.


Version: 0.9.25 [2010-11-30]
o BUG FIX: Argument 'flavor' of segmentByPairedPSCBS() would be ignored
  if multiple chromosomes were segmented.
o BUG FIX: extractByChromosome() for PSCBS would call it self instead
  of extractByChromosomes().


Version: 0.9.24 [2010-11-28]
o BUG FIX: postsegmentTCN() did not handle loci with the same positions
  and that are split in two different segments.  It also did not exclude
  loci with missing values.


Version: 0.9.23 [2010-11-28]
o BUG FIX: The algorithm in segmentByCBS() that infers which loci (of
  the ones share the same genomic positions) that should be exclude
  from each segment did not take missing signals into account.
o BUG FIX: Iff argument 'chromosome' to segmentByPairedPSCBS() was of
  length greater than one and specified exactly one unique chromosome,
  then exception "Number of elements in argument 'chromosome' should
  be exactly 8712 not 86209 value(s)" would be thrown.


Version: 0.9.22 [2010-11-27]
o BUG FIX: bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() would incorrectly include
  non-polymorphic loci in the set of homozygous SNPs during resampling.
o BUG FIX: segmentByPairedPSCBS() would not accept missing values in
  argument 'chromosome'.


Version: 0.9.21 [2010-11-27]
o Now arguments '...' of segmentByPairedPSCBS() are passed to
  the two segmentByCBS() calls.
o Added callSegmentationOutliers(), which can be used to identify
  single-locus outliers that have a genomic signal that is clearly
  outside the expected range.  The dropSegmentationOutliers() sets
  locus outliers detected by this method to missing values.
  This is useful for excluding total copy-number outliers that
  otherwise can have a dramatic impact on the non-robust CBS method.


Version: 0.9.20 [2010-11-26]
o Added optional argument 'chromosomes' to plotTracks() to plot a
  subset of all chromosomes.
o Added extractByChromosomes() for PSCBS.
o Now the default confidence intervals for plotTracks() is (0.05,0.95),
  if existing.
o Now all call functions estimate symmetric bootstrap quantiles for
  convenience of plotting confidence intervals.
o BUG FIX: callABandHighAI() for PairedPSCBS used the old DH-only
  bootstrap method.
o BUG FIX: The statistical sanity checks of the bootstrap estimates
  would give an error when only single-sided bootstrap confidence
  interval was calculated.
o BUG FIX: The call functions, for instance callABandHighAI(), would throw
  'Error in quantile.default(x, probs = alpha) : missing values and NaN's
  not allowed if 'na.rm' is FALSE' unless bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() was
  run before.


Version: 0.9.19 [2010-11-23]
o ROBUSTNESS: Added more sanity checks to bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion().
o WORKAROUND: The precision of the mean levels of DNAcopy::segment()
  is not great enough to always compare it to that of R's estimates.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() would give an error if there was
  only one segment.
o BUG FIX: segmentByPairedPSCBS() and bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion()
  would not subset the correct set of DH signals if there were some
  missing values in TCN.


Version: 0.9.18 [2010-11-22]
o Added argument 'calls' to plotTracks() for highlighting called regions.
o Updated callAllelicBalanceByDH() and callExtremeAllelicImbalanceByDH()
  to utilize bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion().
o ROBUSTNESS: Now drawConfidenceBands() of PairedPSCBS silently does
  nothing if the requested bootstrap quantiles are available.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS would not
  correctly detect if bootstrap results are already available.


Version: 0.9.17 [2010-11-21]
o Now plotTracks() supports tracks "tcn,c1", "tcn,c2" and "c1,c2" too.
o Added support for flavor "tcn&dh" in segmentByPairedPSCBS(), which
  contrary to "tcn,dh" enforces TCN and DH to have the same change
  points.  The default flavor is now "tcn&dh".
o Added argument 'xlim' to plotTracks() making it possible to zoom in.


Version: 0.9.16 [2010-11-21]
o Now joinSegments=TRUE is the default for segmentByCBS() and
  segmentByPairedPSCBS().
o Added argument 'quantiles' to plotTracks(), which if specified
  draws confidence bands previously estimated from bootstrapping.
o Added drawConfidenceBands() for PairedPSCBS.
o Added bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS.
o Added standalone joinSegments() for CBS results.
o Now segmentByPairedPSCBS() also returns minor and major
  copy numbers for each segment.


Version: 0.9.15 [2010-11-21]
o Adjusted postsegmentTCN() such that the updated TCN segment boundaries
  are the maximum of the DH segment and the support by the loci.  This
  means that postsegmentTCN() will work as expected both when signals
  where segmented with 'joinSegments' being TRUE or FALSE.
o Updated plotTracks() for PairedPSCBS such that the TCN segmentation
  is colored 'purple' and the DH segmentation 'orange' for TCN and DH
  only tracks.


Version: 0.9.14 [2010-11-20]
o Now it is possible to specify the boundaries of the regions to
  be segmented as known change points via argument 'knownCPs'.
o Added argument 'joinSegments' to segmentByCBS() and
  segmentByPairedPSCBS() in order to specify if neighboring
  segments should be joined or not.
o Now segmentByCBS() and segmentByPairedPSCBS() allow for
  unknown genomic positions as well as missing total CN signals.


Version: 0.9.13 [2010-11-19]
o Added argument 'joinSegments' to segmentByCBS() in order to specify
  if neighboring segments should be joined or not.


Version: 0.9.12 [2010-11-19]
o Added plotTracks() and drawLevels() etc to CBS results.
o Now segmentByCBS() allows for unknown genomic positions.
o Now segmentByCBS() allows for missing signals.
o Added argument 'preserveOrder' to segmentByCBS().  If TRUE, then
  the loci in the returned 'data' object are ordered as the input
  data, otherwise it is ordered along the genome.


Version: 0.9.11 [2010-11-16]
o Now the 'data' object returned by segmentByCBS() contains field
  'index' if and only if the loci had to be reorder along the genome.
o DOCUMENTATION: Added more details, references to papers, and cross
  links to other functions to the help pages.
o BUG FIX: In the rare cases where two loci at the same positions are
  split up into two neighboring segments, then segmentByPairedPSCBS()
  would fail to infer which they were if and only if the loci were not
  ordered along the genome.  This could happen with for instance
  Affymetrix GenomeWideSNP_6 data.


Version: 0.9.10 [2010-11-09]
o Added argument 'cex=1' to plotTracks().
o BUG FIX: It was not possible to plot BAF tracks with plotTracks().


Version: 0.9.9 [2010-11-05]
o BUG FIX: segmentByCBS() tried to pass non-existing argument
  'undo.split' to DNAcopy::segment().  It should be 'undo.splits'.


Version: 0.9.8 [2010-11-04]
o BUG FIX: There was a stray/debug stop() statement left in
  segmentByPairedPSCBS() causing an "error" in the rare case
  when loci that have the same physical locations are split
  into two different segments.


Version: 0.9.7 [2010-11-03]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now bootstrapDHByRegion() uses resample() of R.utils.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapDHByRegion() did not sample from the correct
  unit(s) when there was only one DH signal.


Version: 0.9.6 [2010-11-02]
o Added arguments 'undoTCN' and 'undoDH' to segmentByPairedPSCBS().
o Added argument 'undo' to segmentByCBS(), which corresponds to
  undo.splits="sdundo" and undo.SD=undo, if undo < +Inf.
o BUG FIX: Arguments 'alphaTCN' and 'alphaDH' of segmentByPairedPSCBS()
  were not used when more than one chromosome were segmented.


Version: 0.9.5 [2010-11-01]
o Added arguments 'alphaAB' and 'alphaHighAI' to callABandHighAI().
o BUG FIX: bootstrapDHByRegion() would give an error if only a single
  quantile was requested.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapDHByRegion() would give "Error in if (nbrOfUnits
  > segJJ[, "dh.num.mark"]) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed"
  when 'dh.num.mark' was NA.


Version: 0.9.4 [2010-10-25]
o Now the default is a 95% confidence interval for calls.
o Now segmentByCBS() also returns element 'lociNotPartOfSegment',
  if there are segments that share end points, which can happen if
  a change point is called in middle of a set of loci that have the
  same genomic positions.  In such cases, 'lociNotPartOfSegment'
  specifies which loci are *not* part of which segment.  Then by
  identifying the loci that are within a segment by their positions
  and excluding any of the above, one knows exactly which loci
  CBS included in each segment.
o BUG FIX: Now bootstrapDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS handles the
  rare case when markers with the same positions are split in
  two different segments.
o BUG FIX: Now the correct set of loci are extracted from each TCN
  segment, in the rare case that two neighboring TCN segments have
  the same end points.


Version: 0.9.3 [2010-10-25]
o Added argument 'ciRange' to callAllelicBalance() and
  callExtremeAllelicImbalance().
o BUG FIX: bootstrapDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS would bootstrap
  from the incorrect set of loci when the DH region contained
  only one locus.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS would bootstrap
  from the incorrect set of loci if more than one chromosome
  was available.


Version: 0.9.2 [2010-10-24]
o BUG FIX: plotTracks() would give "Error: object 'nbrOfLoci' not found'
  for whole-genome plots.


Version: 0.9.1 [2010-10-20]
o Now plotTracks() can plot whole-genome data.


Version: 0.9.0 [2010-10-18]
o Added arguments 'alphaTCN' and 'alphaDH' to segmentByPairedPSCBS()
  with defaults according to the paper.


Version: 0.8.3 [2010-10-18]
o Now segmentByPairedPSCBS() can segment multiple chromosomes.


Version: 0.8.2 [2010-10-17]
o Added argument 'tbn' to segmentByPairedPSCBS() specifying whether
  TumorBoostNormalization should be applied or not.


Version: 0.8.1 [2010-10-10]
o The default for segmentByPairedPSCBS() is now to segment TCN on
  the original scale, not the sqrt().
o Added plotTracks() for PairedPSCBS.


Version: 0.8.0 [2010-10-06]
o CLEAN UP: Removed all old code, native code and help pages.


Version: 0.7.8 [2010-10-03]
o Added optional argument 'chromosome' to segmentByCBS().
  Note that at this point it is only used for annotating the
  results; it can not be used to segmented multiple chromosomes
  at ones.


Version: 0.7.7 [2010-09-26]
o Now subsetBySegments() and postsegmentTCN() for PairedPSCBS
  handles multiple chromosomes.


Version: 0.7.6 [2010-09-24]
o Added support to annotating and subsetting also by chromosomes,
  as well as appending segmentation results from different chromosomes
  together.


Version: 0.7.5 [2010-09-21]
o Added postsegmentTCN() for PairedPSCBS, which updates the
  TCN segment start and ends, estimates and counts given the
  DH segments.


Version: 0.7.4 [2010-09-18]
o Added argument 'chromosome' to segmentByPairedPSCBS(), which, if given,
  adds a chromosome column to the data and segmentation results.
o BUG FIX: plot() for PairedPSCBS used a non-defined variable.


Version: 0.7.3 [2010-09-16]
o Added callABandHighAI() for calling paired PSCBS segmentation results.
o Added internal bootstrapping functions.


Version: 0.7.2 [2010-09-15]
o Added more methods for the PSCBS class.


Version: 0.7.1 [2010-09-08]
o Added more methods for the PSCBS class.
o Now segmentByPairedPSCBS() also returns the TumorBoost normalized data.


Version: 0.7.0 [2010-09-04]
o Updated segmentByPairedPSCBS() to provide two-step segmentation
  from first segmenting the total copy numbers and then the
  decrease-of-heterozygosity signals.  Added utility functions for
  plotting the results.  The code for calling allelic imbalance
  and LOH is still to be added.


Version: 0.6.3 [2010-09-02]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now segmentByCBS() also works if there are no data points.


Version: 0.6.2 [2010-07-14]
o CLEAN UP: Added callNaiveHeterzygotes() which is a cleaned up
  version of findheterozygous().  Added an Rd example that asserts
  that the two are identical and compares the calls to those of
  aroma.light::callNaiveGenotypes().


Version: 0.6.1 [2010-07-09]
o Added low-level segmentByPairedPSCBS(), which runs paired PSCBS
  segmentation on a single sample and a single chromosome.
  It only segments; it does not call segments.  This is only
  a stub in the sense that it still does not adjust p-values etc.
o Added low-level segmentByCBS(), which runs CBS segmentation
  on a single sample and a single chromosome.
o BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: Now psCNA() returns a list of length 8.
o Reverted psSegment() back to v0.5.6.


Version: 0.6.0 [2010-07-08]
o Now psSegmentPaired() returns a data frame (no longer a matrix).
o CLEANUP: Major cleanup, i.e. renaming variables, reordering etc.
o CLEANUP: Created psSegmentPaired() from psSegment().
o ROBUSTNESS: Replaced all 1:n with seq(length=n) to deal with n == 0.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all list elements are referenced by name.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all iterator variables are written as ii, jj etc.
o Using setMethodS3() of R.methodsS3 to define S3 method.
o Dropping NAMESPACE while package is finished.  This makes it
  easier to patch methods etc.


Version: 0.5.6 [2010-07-07]
o Added example(psSegment).
o BUG FIX: Previous clean up introduced bugs.
o BUG FIX: The dynamic library for hrmode() was not loaded.


Version: 0.5.5 [2010-05-05]
o CLEAN UP/ROBUSTNESS: Major code clean up.


Version: 0.5.4 [2010-04-30]
o Added internal hrmode().
o CLEAN UP: Renamed source files to match function names.
  Only only function per source file.


Version: 0.5.3 [2010-04-22]
o ABO updated the psCBS algorithm.


Version: 0.5.2 [2010-0?-??]
o ???


Version: 0.5.1 [2010-03-31]
o Now psSegment(..., matching.reference=TRUE) does TumorBoost
  normalization on the allele B fractions before segmentation.


Version: 0.5.0 [2010-03-12]
o Added to R-forge repository.
